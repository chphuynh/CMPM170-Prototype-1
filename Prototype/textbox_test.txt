Lead Detective (LD): We got this security cam footage from the crime scene. Our guys are still sweeping for anything suspicious, but maybe our tech experts can get something out of this.
Tech Expert (TE): No biggie. I can do this in my sleep.
Zoom in on PLANT:
TE: Hmm… Let’s zoom in on that plant. There’s something suspicious in the pot.
LD: Is that… a knife? Could be the murder weapon!
TE: I don’t know… It seems too easy. That plant isn’t even alive.
LD: Are you suggesting…?
TE: Yes. Someone killed that plant with the knife. If only we could connect this to the rest of the scene.
Zoom in on LAPTOP:
TE: Zoom in over there. Yep. Just what I thought.
LD: It’s a laptop.
TE: Obviously. But it’s what’s on the laptop that’s important.
LD: Well, yeah, but we couldn’t find the laptop when we got there, so unless you can determine the contents from this footage, we’ve got nothing.
TE: What is this, 1990? Any computer expert can get that information. I’ll do you one better. There. I’ve downloaded the code from the image of the screen that we can see.
LD: You can do that? From a low-quality security cam image?
TE: Please. This is child’s play.
